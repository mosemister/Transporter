# Transporter
Transporter is a Bukkit Minecraft project that allows a admin to create a "gate" which is linked directly with another "gate". when the gates sign is clicked, the gate will expand if needed to fit the object you are transporting. the gate will then move across your what you are transporting, transporting it layer by layer.

Gates can be linked with any other gate and do not need to be linked on both ends. but can be. You can have a gate as just a reciver and nothing else.
